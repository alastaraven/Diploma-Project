The work is presented as a diploma design for the course "Web developer 2035" by ITMO. All data provided is for informational purposes only.

What makes up the structure of the landing page:
<ul>
	<li>
		The site header is a logo on the left, a navigation
menu in the middle and social network icons on the right;</li>
	<li>
		The main (first) screen is the H1 header with a description of the product and
a button with a transition to the collection on the left and an image of a digital painting
on the right;</li>
	<li>
		Content – is a text and graphic content
consisting of several sections: <b>"Unique collection"</b>, <b>"Coins"</b>,
<b>"Roadmap"</b>, <b>"About us"</b>, <b>"Team"</b>, <b>"Description of the collection"</b>, <b>"Question — answer"</b>, <b>"We
are always in touch"</b>;</li>
	<li>
		The footer of the site consists of the name of the collection with the text of protection from
copying, links to technical pages (<b>"Privacy Policy"</b> and <b>"Terms +
Guarantees"</b>,), links to social networks in the form of icons;</li>
</ul>
		The background of the site is uniform, black, fills all
the free space.
<br>	
In accordance with this structure, a one–page landing site was developed.
It is worth saying right away that the site page is made in a minimalistic
style, with a minimum of animations and interactive elements.
To switch between landing sections, hyperlinks were implemented,
presented in the form of a navigation menu, which is located in the header.
<br>
<br>
When developing the site, these technologies were used:
<br>
<i>Visual Studio Code</i> is one of the most common
code editors developed by Microsoft. It is distributed
free of charge and is supported by all current operating
systems: Windows, Linux and macOS. Visual Studio Code is a
regular text editor with the ability to connect various
plug-ins, which makes it possible to work with all kinds
of programming languages for the development of any IT product. Visual Studio Code
it was used for manual correction of some shortcomings that arose
during the development and programming in JavaScript.
<br>
<i>Google Chrome</i> is a web browser developed by Google
based on the free Chromium browser and the Blink engine. The browser
was used to test the operation of the site at different screen resolutions in
the “devtools” mode.
<br>
<i>Figma</i> is an online service for interface development and
prototyping with the ability to organize collaboration in
real time.
